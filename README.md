2. Try (re-)installing the stock Weather, Calendar and Reminders app from Apple.

3. Make sure to manually add a location to your Weather app. Don't worry it will still take your location services location if you have it enabled. *If you are using an iPad with iPad OS please make sure to use the Weather Widget to have the Kalm weather option working properly!* If you're using location services for the weather, make sure to enable it for App & Widgets here: Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Weather > While using the App or Widgets

4. Try disabling **<ins>all(!)</ins>** (not only lockscreen) Tweaks except Kalm in iCleaner to check if there is a conflicting tweak.

5. Try removing the Kalm preferences file *hi.my.name.is.ubik.kalm.plist* in */var/mobile/Library/Preferences* and respring.

6. Try re-jailbreaking.
