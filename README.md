### This is the only official place for Kalm bug reports.

## General steps to try before creating an issue

1. Make sure to manually add a location to your Weather app. Don't worry it will still take your location services location if you have it enabled. *If you are using an iPad with iPad OS please make sure to use the Weather Widget to have the Kalm weather option working properly!*

2. Try (re-)installing the stock Weather app from Apple.

3. Try (re-)installing the stock Calendar app and Reminders app from Apple.

4. Try disabling **<ins>all</ins>** (not only LS) Tweaks except Kalm in iCleaner to check if there is a conflicting tweak.

5. Try removing the Kalm preferences file *hi.my.name.is.ubik.kalm.plist* in */var/mobile/Library/Preferences* and respring.
